> A SPA that provides a tool for outlining a novel.

If you're going to outline a novel (or any form of structured fiction) then probably the best solution is to grab a pencil and some paper (maybe a ruler too) and go at it manually in the old-fashioned way. This worked [perfectly well](https://flashbak.com/jkrowling-sketches-harry-potter-plot-spreadsheet-400969/) for J.K. Rowling.

However, for whatever reason, I've found myself on more than one occasion writing html tables from scratch in order to avoid the tedium of drawing boxes that will end up too small or too big or having to start the whole thing over because I've realised chapter 5 is actually chapter 2 and so on. 

The fact I find writing raw HTML less tedious than either paper probably says something vaguely important about my psyche that may or may not be worth paying attention to.

Raw HTML has quite a few limitations. It's not pleasant to edit. Reordering table rows is cumbersome. And I have to alternate between a text editor and a browser when I'm either editing or surveying. I found myself wanting to be able to change the order of the table rows in browser, or edit their contents, or select a different colour, or, depending on what I was doing, to sort them chronologically, by setting, title or by chapter. 

These are all things that could be achieved using Excel. Pretty much my only reasons for not using Excel are wanting the table layout to be decided for me automatically (Excel can probably do that) and wanting the UI to be as simple and specific to the task as possible.
